        To convert centimeters to inches, you need to know the conversion factor
        between these two units of length. One inch is equivalent to 2.54
        centimeters. Therefore, to convert centimeters to inches, you divide the
        number of centimeters by 2.54. In this case, we have 28 centimeters that
        we want to convert to inches. The calculation proceeds as follows:
        [28cm√∑2.54=11.02inches] So, 28 centimeters is approximately equal to
        11.02 inches. To achieve this result, we simply divided the given number
        of centimeters by the conversion factor (2.54) that represents how many
        centimeters are in an inch. This simple division helps in converting
        from one unit of measurement to another, ensuring accuracy in
        measurements across different systems (metric and imperial in this
        case). Here are 7 items that are approximately 28 cm in length, with a
